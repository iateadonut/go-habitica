# go-habitica
golang client for habitica, a free habit building productivity app

## NOTE
This client is not ready yet. I'll do my best to flesh out most of the endpoints.

## Purpose
- I need this client for another IoT related project that I want to work on.
- I wanted to learn the idiomatic way of writing golang clients.
  This client is heavily influenced for today's notion of "best practices" for building clients.
  I'm using [go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github) as a guide.

## Project
I'm going to create tasks in [this project](https://github.com/wfernandes/go-habitica/projects/1)
to keep track of the work and progress.
